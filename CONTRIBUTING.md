   Check the [GitHub Issues](../../issues) to see if the problem has already been reported.

2. **Open a New Issue:**  
   - Use the **Bug Report** template.  
   - Provide a clear title and thorough description.  
   - Include:  
     - Steps to reproduce  
     - Expected vs. actual behavior  
     - Browser console errors or screenshots  
     - Your environment (browser version, OS, GPU)

We aim to respond promptly. Please be responsive to follow-up questions.

### 2. Suggesting Features or Improvements

We welcome new ideas that can enhance Celeris-WebGPU:

1. **Check for Existing Requests:**  
   See if thereâ€™s an open discussion or issue for your idea.

2. **Open a Feature Request:**  
   - Use the **Feature Request** template.
